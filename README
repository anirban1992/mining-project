We did not experiment much with other distance metrics, but we have written the code, in such a way, that one has to simply replace words, such as ‘Ward’, ‘Euclidean’ etc, with the other alternative. Also, we have stuck to a lot with Euclidean metric. However, observing our code, one can see that we have created a simple provision to test other metrics.
So if you want to test the code against the other metrics you can just replace these keywords with the metric you want to test against.

To execute the Code:

make step2

Executing ‘make step2’ : 
Would first execute fetcher.py .
Would execute my_data_parser.py.
